              We all are accustomed to social distancing because of the great
              pandemic which left us with new challenges. As Schools, Colleges,
              Universities and Companies are reopening and the crowd is getting
              gathered back again. It might be really tough to follow the rules
              and take precautions. With every new challenge comes a new
              proposition.

              We Company Mukham Inc, a fully student driven Start-up
              accelerating from VIT-AP emerged with a new Mobile Application
              which can be installed for facial attendance with 100% Social
              Distancing. It uses Geotagging to know the location of the
              particular user and if the user is not within the range the app
              wonâ€™t allow him to mark attendance.
